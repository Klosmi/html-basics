# [What is Node JS?](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-node)
Node JS is a JS runtime that executes outside of the browser.   
In other words, Node JS is an implementation of JS that runs outside of the browser.

It doesn't rely on other languages, it uses JavaScript. *(Before JS was only running on web browsers.)*

Some examples of what is built or uses with Node JS: 
- Web Servers
- Command Line Tools (application that run in command line, eg. npm)
- Native Apps (eg. VSCode, Slack is a Node application)
- Games
- Netflix uses it
- etc.
