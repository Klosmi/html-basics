# [Basic commands: `LS`, `PWD`, etc.](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/introduction-to-bash-shell/#:~:text=cd%20~%20(the%20tilde).,in%20which%20the%20Terminal%20opens)      
__Home Directory__ â–º __`~`__ :     
the default directory (the default location) in which the Terminal opens.    
 (Usually our user account directory. If we have 5 accounts, each account has its own home directory.)    

- tilde __`~`__ is a shortcut way of referencig our home directory (if we want to "go home").   

<br>

__List__ â–º __`ls`__ :    
a list of the current contents of the directory that we are in at the moment.      
command: __`ls`__  â–º brings back to your home directory
 
 <br>

__Print Working Directory__ â–º __`pwd`__ :     
 a quick way of orientating, shows which directory we are, so that's how we now where we are.

 <br>

__Change Directory__ â–¶ï¸Ž __`cd`__ :   
to move forward or backwards.   
tpye: `cd` and then some directory that we want to change directories into.    
 - eg.:   `cd DirectoryName` 

To __back up a directory__ : __`cd ..`__ (cd followed by __`..`__) 

 - eg.:   
  *We are in the /Code/Mydirectory/Foldername/*   
  *We want to go back to Mydirectory*  
  *We type:* `cd ..` *and we are in /Code/Mydirectory/* .    
  *If we write it again* `cd ..` *we go back to /Code/ directory.*
