# Inline vs Block
- **By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow** 

- **Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur (although, as usual, this can be changed using CSS)**
- *How an element fits in with the flow of content.*
- *we can change the behaviour with CSS*
---
##  **Block levelel element:**
**Something wants to exist on its own line, its own *"block"*.**
- we can inspect it
- `<h1>` all headings
- `<p>`


### **`<div>`**
- It's a block level element (eg. it takes up the whole block).
- What is [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)?
- The HTML Content Division element (`<div>`) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
- `<div>` is a content division or divider element.
- it's used to group elements
- a generic container

##  **Inline element:**
**Take out the minimum amount of space**
- `<a>` anchor tag --> share the space
- `<img>`
- [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) : a generic container, but it is an inline element (*same idea as `div`, but it's inline*).
- wrap around a text, to single out, so to use style it with CSS for instance.
