# [(Other) Useful CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) :    
these are a few CSS properties which are nice to know, but not crucial for the basic knowledge.

## [Alpha Channel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity) + [Opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity)
  
  <br>

 [RGB**A**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgba()) - **Alpha Channel**:  : 

  The `rgba()` [functional notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions) expresses a color according to its red, green, and blue components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.    

  **The 'a' from the 'rgba' is the alpha, which governs the transparency of the color**.  

  - it is a value from 0 to 1.
    - eg.:
      ###### *The HTML*
      ```
        <section>
          <div id="rgba">
              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
              <button>Button</button>
          </div>
      ``` 
      ###### *The CSS:  we give background-color to the `<div>`*
      ```
      #rgba {
        background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7) /* → 0.7 is the alpha channel, here it's partially transparent. */
      }
      ```
      Only the background color will be partially transparent. The text and `<button>` are not. Only the element which have the `RGBA` value will be impacted.


    - you can add `Alpha Channel` to hexadecimal colors : add two digits at the and of the hexadecimal color from 00 to FF.
      - `00` full transparency is.
      - `FF` is no transparency at all.
        - eg.:
          ###### *CSS, hexadecimal color eg.: `#60f7ab` + `4f` alpha channel.*
          ```
            #hex {
              background-color: #60f7ab4f     /* → #60f7ab  + 4f */
            }
          ```

      <br>

  **[Opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity#values)** :   
  The opacity CSS property **sets the opacity of an element**. Opacity is **the degree to which content behind an element is hidden**, and is the **opposite of transparency**.

  Opacity is not a part of a color or a channel like rgb**a**.   
  Opacity is a property we set on an element which governs the entire element's "transparency" (although it is not transparency), **including its contents and any descendants**.   
  - eg.: 
    ###### *The HTML*
    ```
      <section>
        <div id="opacity">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
            <button>Button</button>
        </div>
    ```
    ###### *The CSS*
    ```
      #opacity {
        background-color: yellow;
        opacity: 0.5;     /* → the background-color has 0.5 opacity */
      }
    ```
    Thet text in the `#opacity` `<div>` and the `<button>` will be transparent too not just the background color. **The entire element within that `<div>` will be impacted by the `opacity`.**
